</h2>
<p>While there has been a lot of research both in favor and 
against one of America's favorite drinks, this latest bit 
of research leaves you feeling a little less guilty after 
having that second, or third, or even fourth cup of coffee.
</p>

<p>The results of a new study suggest that drinking up to four 
cups of coffee a day may reduce your risk of developing cancer of 
the endometrium, or the lining of the uterus, according to researchers.
</p>
<p>Published in the February issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & 
Prevention, scientists found that drinking roughly 26 to 37 ounces of 
coffee per day reduced endometrial cancer by up to 18 percent.


<p>"We were not surprised by the results that a high versus low intake of 
coffee was associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer, because 
they were consistent with what has been observed in previous studies," said 
study author Melissa Merritt, who is also a research fellow in cancer 
epidemiology at Imperial College London in England.

<p>Late last year the Retail Food Group, the largest multi-brand 
retail food franchiser in Australia, announced plans to acquire 
the Di Bella Coffee Company, one of that country’s largest specialty 
coffee roasters. That acquisition was complete as of February of 
this year, and now RFG, which also owns the Gloria Jean’s and It’s 
A Grind brands, has set its sights on the United States as a territory 
rich in target markets to grow the brand.</p>

<p>In what remains largely a batch-brew America, slivers of Aussie influence 
have been steadily surfacing. Starbucks recently introduced the Flat White to 
its menu, and a few more authentic examples include the Los Angeles roaster 
Longshot Coffee, which proudly boasts of its Australian heart and soul, the 
Bluestone Lane company, which has half opened a dozen locations around New York 
City, and the Brooklyn-based roaster Toby’s Estate, which was founded originally 
by Toby Smith in a cottage by his mother’s home in the Woolloomooloo suburb of 
Sydney.</p>


<p>The Australian coffee scene is one that generally earns the admiration of 
higher-end espresso businesses in the US and around the world. Ever since 
throngs of Italians melded into Australian society after World War I, the 
espresso scene there has enjoyed a homogenous edge over other coffee cultures, 
which is an edge that the US industry has increasingly sought to adopt, albeit 
in a slow and incremental way.
</p>

<p>“Di Bella Coffee will be a coffee supplier to individual café owners and outfits 
who wish to have that sort of high-end specialty coffee for their businesses,” 
said Alford, describing Di Bella as a wholesaler that will be entering markets 
in major US cities, where it will compete with smaller local roasters that also 
offer wholesale services. “They’re obviously the key target markets for us, they 
have an espresso culture, and we certainly want to be part of that.”</p>
